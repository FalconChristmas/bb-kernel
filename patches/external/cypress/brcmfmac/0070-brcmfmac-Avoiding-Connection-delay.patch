Subject: [PATCH 070/208] brcmfmac: Avoiding Connection delay

Channel info passed by supplicant is not given to firmware. This causes
delay (about 3seconds) due to full scan. Supplicant already provides the
channel info for the specific SSID. channel_hint carries this channel
info for the connect call back.

Patch has been verified on 43012 and 43455.

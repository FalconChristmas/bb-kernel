Subject: [PATCH 077/208] brcmfmac: Fix authentication latency caused by OBSS
 stats survey

Auto Channel Select feature of HostAP uses dump_survey to fetch
OBSS statistics. When the device is in the middle of an authentication
sequence or just at the end of authentication completion, running
dump_survey would trigger a channel change. The channel change in-turn
can cause packet loss, resulting in authentication delay. With this change,
dump_survey wont be run when authentication or association is in progress &
hence resolving the issue.
